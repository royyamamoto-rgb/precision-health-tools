First calculate your BMR using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, multiply by your activity factor to get TDEE, then subtract 500 for a safe deficit of about 1 pound per week. For example, a 30-year-old male, 175cm, 75kg with moderate activity has a TDEE of ~2,633 kcal — a fat loss target would be ~2,106 kcal/day."

For women: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) − (5 × age) − 161. Published in 1990, it's recommended by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics over the older Harris-Benedict equation."
